# Crowdsourcing of Evidences Ontology (CEO)
Ontology to describe the crowdsourcing campaigns for collecting sources from the general public

Competency Questions:

- What outcomes crowdsource campaigns produced?
- Which organization is organising a crowdsource campaign?
- Who is managing what aspect of the campaign?
- How is contributing to crowdsourcing campaing and producing what outcome?
- Which experiential concepts a task is addressing?
- Given an experiential concept, which resources are being generated to inform about this concept?

## Scenario
In the context of research project is often necessary to collect material from a crowdsource campaign. A campaign can be managed by one or more actors (organizations and people) with the aim of collecting a type of resource. Participants may be compensated for participating to one or more tasks. The tasks and campaign in general produces and users resources.

## Usage Example
This ontology is used to describe the crowdsource campaign of the EU JPI [READ-IT project](https://readit-project.eu/). The crowdsource campaigns are carried along the duration of the project and with different modalities (see [contribute page](https://readit-project.eu/contact/contribute-to-read-it/)), such as physical postcards during events, an online [contribution platform](https://read-it.in-two.com/), conversation with a chatbot [@TellMeWhatUReadingbot](https://t.me/tellmewhatureadingbot).

The folder `chatbot`includes examples of data generated by the chatbot and scripts to convert individual documents in a JSON-LD graph.

## JSON-LD
Support to `json-ld` by including the context in `json-ld/context.json` file.
```https://github.com/eureadit/crowdsourcing-ontology/raw/master/json-ld/context.json```

Examples are included in the `json-ld/examples/` folder, such as:

```

## Acknowledgements
This ontology is inspired by the following is mostly based on the "[Ontology focused crowdsourcing management](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.promfg.2015.07.286)" of Ari Sivula, Jussi Kantola. This work is a readaptation as it changes the focus from the organization (e.g. maturity level of the organization) to the operational aspects of the crowdsourcing: the campaigning and production of resources.
