# Crowdsourcing Evidences
Ontology to describe the crowdsourcing campaigns for collecting sources from the general public

Competency Questions:

- What outcomes crowdsource campaigns produced?
- Which organization is organising a crowdsource campaign?
- Who is managing what aspect of the campaign?
- How is contributing to crowdsourcing campaing and producing what outcome?

## Scenario
In the context of research project is often necessary to collect material from a crowdsource campaign. A campaign can be managed by one or more actors (organizations and people) with the aim of collecting a type of resource. Participants may be compensated for participating to one or more tasks. The tasks and campaign in general produces and users resources.

## Usage Example
This ontology is used to describe the crowdsource campaign of the EU JPI [READ-IT project](https://readit-project.eu/). The crowdsource campaigns are carried along the duration of the project and with different modalities (see [contribute page](https://readit-project.eu/contact/contribute-to-read-it/)), such as physical postcards during events, an online [contribution platform](https://read-it.in-two.com/), conversation with a chatbot [@TellMeWhatUReadingbot](https://t.me/tellmewhatureadingbot).

## Acknowledgements
This ontology is inspired by the following is mostly based on the [Ontology focused crowdsourcing management](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.promfg.2015.07.286) of Ari Sivula, Jussi Kantola. This work is a readaptation as it changes the focus from the organization (e.g. maturity level of the organization) to the operational aspects of the crowdsourcing: the campaigning and production of resources.

Furthermore, the ontology is insired or reuses entities from the following:
