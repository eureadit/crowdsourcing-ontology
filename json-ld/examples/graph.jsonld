            "co:answerText":"I remember reading a non-fiction book, Alessandro Manzoni's Storia della Colonna Infame as part of my Italian Literature exam at university. A few days after finishing it I visited Milan, where the book is set, and read one of the inscriptions mentioned by Manzoni. It celebrated  the torture and execution of two men during the 1630 plague epidemic. Manzoni's Storia della Colonna Infame demonstrated that they were falsely accused of spreading the plague and did not deserve to suffer and die. I did not know the inscription had survived. Reading it brought me close to tears and reminded me of the reality of those tragic events.\nBefore reading the book, I had heard sections of it read in class by my Italian Literature professor, Ezio Raimondi. I then read the book and finally the inscription in Milan. Together they made an indelible impression on me."
